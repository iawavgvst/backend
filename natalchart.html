            <p>The expression natal chart is used exclusively to refer to the birth chart of an individual.</p>
            <p>This concept is based on constructing a horoscope or natal chart that includes the exact date, time, and location of an individual's birth. Natal astrology is found in the Indian or Jyotisha, Chinese and Western astrological traditions.</p>
            <p>But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.</p>
