            <h3>How do you can do it?</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>With the Sun defining a certain portion of our personality, we have to admit that it will influence the same center of power in all other people. From this point of view, compatibility of different Sun signs speaks of primal instinctive recognition and the potential two people have for mutual respect. Although these matters will truly be seen only through the rulers of the signs where the two Suns are set and other personal positions, this sort of interpretation gives us insight into the basic awareness one person has for the other. It will speak of the way creative energies will intertwine and grow, initiatives of two people collide or support each other, and if they will instantly find unity between their personalities or not.</p>

            <h3>Sun and Personality</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Personality is pretty much defined by the position of one's natal Sun. Although it will only show a glimpse of light on character, the Sun is still the largest body in the Solar system. It gives us life and makes everything else turn around it, and will stand for the nature one is most likely to lean towards over the years. It is our inner beam of light and our personal gravitational pull, defining us in time even if it manifests through our boss, father, authority, or anyone else in its symbolism. We all do everything we can to reach the power from our personal Sun, and it helps us sense the power of will in other people too. Our Sun sign will teach us about personal boundaries, respect towards ourselves and everyone else, and speak of the instinctive approach we have towards different individuals that come into our lives.</p>

            <h3>Relationship in Astrology</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>There is no way to fully grasp two personalities and their contact based solely on compatibility of their Sun signs. In order to truly approach the relationship between two people as a special entity that lives its own life, we have to use personal data, both natal charts, their comparison, and methods such as midpoint and Davison's method in order to find specific stories of each couple. Just like it is impossible to view all people through twelve drawers of the twelve basic Sun signs, it is also not possible to view their relationships based on the same primal division.</p>
